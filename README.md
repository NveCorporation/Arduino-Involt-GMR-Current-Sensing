# Arduino-GMR-Current-Sensing
Read a GMR magnetometer over a trace with an Arduino and display the current throgh the trace on a virtual meter.

Uses an NVE AAL004 magnetometer sensor, an Arduino Uno, Canvas Gauges, and the Involt Arduino-to-HTML framework (based on the Chrome browser and NW.js; previously known as node-webkit).
